// How to use this:
//
// 1. Build some system to #include glsl files in each other.
//   Include this one at the very start. Or just paste everywhere.
// 2. Build a sphere tracer. See those papers:
//   * "Sphere Tracing" https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs003710050084
//   * "Enhanced Sphere Tracing" http://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/stag.20141233.001-008
//   * "Improved Ray Casting of Procedural Distance Bounds" https://www.bibsonomy.org/bibtex/258e85442234c3ace18ba4d89de94e57d
//   The Raymnarching Toolbox Thread on pouet can be helpful as well
//   http://www.pouet.net/topic.php?which=7931&page=1
//   and contains links to many more resources.
// 3. Use the tools in this library to build your distance bound f().
// 4. ???
// 5. Win a compo.
// 
// (6. Buy us a beer or a good vodka or something, if you like.)

//
// Why use this?
//
// The point of this lib is that everything is structured according
// to patterns that we ended up using when building geometry.
// It makes it more easy to write code that is reusable and that somebody
// else can actually understand. Especially code on Shadertoy (which seems
// to be what everybody else is looking at for "inspiration") tends to be
// really ugly. So we were forced to do something about the situation and
// release this lib ;)
//
// Everything in here can probably be done in some better way.
// Please experiment. We'd love some feedback, especially if you
// use it in a scene production.
//
// The main patterns for building geometry this way are:
// * Stay Lipschitz continuous. That means: don't have any distance
//   gradient larger than 1. Try to be as close to 1 as possible -
//   Distances are euclidean distances, don't fudge around.
//   Underestimating distances will happen. That's why calling
//   it a "distance bound" is more correct. Don't ever multiply
//   distances by some value to "fix" a Lipschitz continuity
//   violation. The invariant is: each fSomething() function returns
//   a correct distance bound.
// * Use very few primitives and combine them as building blocks
//   using combine opertors that preserve the invariant.
// * Multiply objects by repeating the domain (space).
//   If you are using a loop inside your distance function, you are
//   probably doing it wrong (or you are building boring fractals).
// * At right-angle intersections between objects, build a new local
//   coordinate system from the two distances to combine them in
//   interesting ways.
// * As usual, there are always times when it is best to not follow
//   specific patterns.

//
// FAQ
//
// Q: Why is there no sphere tracing code in this lib?
// A: Because our system is way too complex and always changing.
//    This is the constant part. Also we'd like everyone to
//    explore for themselves.
//
// Q: This does not work when I paste it into Shadertoy!!!!
// A: Yes. It is GLSL, not GLSL ES. We like real OpenGL
//    because it has way more features and is more likely
//    to work compared to browser-based WebGL. We recommend
//    you consider using OpenGL for your productions. Most
//    of this can be ported easily though.
//
// Q: How do I material?
// A: We recommend something like this:
//    Write a material ID, the distance and the local coordinate
//    p into some global variables whenever an object's distance is
//    smaller than the stored distance. Then, at the end, evaluate
//    the material to get color, roughness, etc., and do the shading.
//
// Q: I found an error. Or I made some function that would fit in
//    in this lib. Or I have some suggestion.
// A: Awesome! Drop us a mail at spheretracing@mercury.sexy.
//
// Q: Why is this not on github?
// A: Because we were too lazy. If we get bugged about it enough,
//    we'll do it.
//
// Q: Your license sucks for me.
// A: Oh. What should we change it to?
//
// Q: I have trouble understanding what is going on with my distances.
// A: Some visualization of the distance field helps. Try drawing a
//    plane that you can sweep through your scene with some color
//    representation of the distance field at each point and/or iso
//    lines at regular intervals. Visualizing the length of the
//    gradient (or better: how much it deviates from being equal to 1)
//    is immensely helpful for understanding which parts of the
//    distance field are broken.
